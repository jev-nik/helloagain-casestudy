Total Hourly Cost

The only resources with fixed hourly costs are the two NAT Gateways. All other resources (VPC, subnets, route tables, routes, Internet Gateway, and associated Elastic IPs) are free in terms of hourly charges. Variable costs (e.g., data transfer or NAT Gateway data processing) depend on usage, which isn’t specified, so I’ve excluded them as requested.

    NAT Gateways: $0.096 per hour (2 × $0.048)
    Total: $0.096 per hour
